# Google-review-rating
In this project i had been provided the data that contain category of google reviews  by different user . I used K-means clustering to cluster the reviews that will help marketing team to target right audience 
# investigating the outliers 
while checking outliers i found out that there are no such outliers

# investigating the null values 
treating null values by filling median

# STANDARDIASE THE DATA
it consist changing values of dataset in standard form that mean between 0 and 1

## applying PCA

### running clusters into for loop between in range of 1,8 to get a fine cluster point

after running the loop i have choosen the cluster on the basis of cuts in the graphs 


## run model on different cluster 
i ran the model on different clusters i.e 4,5,6

### visulization of groups at different clusters

i visualise the group in different categories and determined the most precise cluster
